Single-agent vs. Multi-agent RAG


SINGLE-AGENT RAG

A single-agent RAG model uses one retriever and one generator to handle the entire query lifecycle. It's effective but has limitations in scale, flexibility, and domain expertise.
* Retriever: Typically a dense vector-based retriever (e.g., FAISS, Elasticsearch) fetches top-k documents.
* Generator: An LLM (e.g., GPT, T5, BART) generates the final answer using both the query and retrieved documents.
Works best when:
	* The knowledge base is homogenous.	
	* The domain is narrow (e.g., tech support).
	* Real-time performance is critical.
Characteristics:
	* Simpler architecture
	* Easier to build and maintain
	* Lower resource usage
	* May be limited in flexibility, specialization, and robustness
Workflow:
1. User Query 
2. Single Retriever (fetches documents from a knowledge base) 
3. Single Generator (creates the answer based on retrieved docs) 
4. Final Output
Limitations
	* Can't adapt well to multiple domains or data types.
	* Limited error checking—if the retriever fails, generation likely fails.
	* Can hallucinate without sufficient external critique.
Applications:
	Customer chatbot retrieving from a single FAQ database.


MULTI-AGENT RAG

Multi-Agent RAG introduces multiple autonomous agents, each with unique capabilities. These agents collaborate, compete, or critique to achieve more accurate, flexible, and scalable responses.
	1.Query Processor Agent :Can break complex queries into parts
	2.Domain-Specific Retriever Agents Each agent may use a tailored embedding model and search strategy
	3.Generator Agents Translate, rephrase, or summarize and focuses on different reasoning methods using different LLMs tuned for particular tasks
	4.Critic/Evaluator  :Fact-check or critique generated content using reasoning chains or voting mechanisms
	5.Synthesizer/Orchestrator :Picks best outputs, merges results, or composes a unified response.
Characteristics:
	* Modular and extensible
	* Parallelism improves performance and depth
	* Allows domain-specific or task-specific agents
	* More complex to manage and orchestrate
Workflow:
1. User Query 
2. Query Decomposer (if needed) 
3. Multiple Retrievers (query different data sources in parallel) 
4. Aggregator (merges and ranks results) 
5. Multiple Generators (produce diverse outputs) 
6. Evaluator/Critic Agent (selects or refines best response) 
7. Synthesizer (final output)
Limitations:
	* Requires orchestration layer (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI).
	* Latency and cost are higher.
	* Requires careful design to avoid conflict or duplication among agents.
Applications:
	* Multi-domain question answering (legal + medical + scientific)
	* Safety-critical applications (via redundancy + critique)
	* Dynamic knowledge sourcing (real-time + offline).
