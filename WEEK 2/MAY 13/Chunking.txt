Chunking
Chunking is a method of breaking down large amounts of information into smaller, manageable parts called "chunks." This technique is used to help people or AI understand, remember, or process data more easily. The main idea is that it's easier to deal with small pieces of information than a long block of text or data.
In AI and machine learning, especially with large language models (LLMs), chunking is used to divide long documents or datasets into smaller parts. This is important because language models like ChatGPT can only read a limited number of words (called tokens) at once. If a document is too long, it must be chunked so the model can process it piece by piece.
There are different ways to chunk text, such as splitting by paragraph, sentence, or a fixed number of words or tokens. Each chunk can then be passed through the model for tasks like summarization, question answering, or translation.
Chunking is also used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. In RAG, the system chunks documents and stores them in a vector database, making it easier to search and retrieve the most relevant parts when answering questions.
Chunking is used in many areas like document summarization, search engines, AI chatbots, note-taking apps, and language translation tools. It helps systems work faster, stay within memory limits, and produce better, more focused results.
In summary, chunking is a helpful technique that makes both human learning and AI processing more efficient. It breaks down big tasks into smaller steps, which are easier to handle. Whether you’re building an AI tool or trying to study better, chunking is a simple but powerful way to improve understanding and performance.
